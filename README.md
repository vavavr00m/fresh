So that's where this list comes into play.

For instance, most humans can't easily tell A and А apart (except when using certain fonts), but computers can instantly tell the former is Latin and the latter is Cyrillic, and adresses with them are treated as different. However, ALL use of non-US letters in URLs will be treated as 'xn--[random letters]' by HTML-based tools, making it relatively easy to block, which this list will do for you. Note: This version blocks ALL use of non-US letters, including non-Latin TLDs like .рф and .台灣; an alternate list version exists that'll let non-Latin TLDs through. Both versions will also block made-for-convenience European redirects like Elkjøp.no.

It blocks heavily abused top-level domains (and even search engine results for them), blocks domains used in malware redirection trains and in domain parking schemes, blocks sponsored Windows PUP nags on PC guide articles, uses mass blocking of domains belonging to bad IPs, and has many other subcategories that give it a solid advantage over similar lists out there.

But at least from a traditional standpoint, many Twitch userbase in-jokes have taken forms that would've been considered racist in many other settings, including emotes that are used to accuse black people of being terrorists, women of being whiny, or businessmen game characters of being Jewish. If you wish for a more squeaky-clean experience that simply considers humans to be humans, here's a list for you.

It combines many of my proudest and most frequently maintained international lists, as a proof-of-concept and as a curated list for simplicity's sake. What this broad compilation blocks in AdGuard and uBO (from top to bottom): Mobile app download banners, highly untrustworthy TLDs (and their Google results), domains that major tech groups lost the ownership of, PC "optimiser" sponsorships, malicious or tracker-inserting adblockers, auto-generated Android root "guides" that will brick your phone, "Share page" buttons, "Download [browser/Acrobat]" buttons, unnecessary login prompts, blurring of article previews, fake notification counters, empty padding (esp. on macOS), gradients when moving your mouse on video embeds, extra dumb comment sections, prayer time clocks on newssites, webstore "coupon" aggregator listings that are not coupons, large subscription promo banners, general annoyances on Dailymotion/Wikia, falling snow on pages, URL parameters believed to be unnecessary or trackers, custom embedded cursors, softens and modernises Japanese fonts on Windows, spacewasting pagelist entries, the "Anonymous animal" bubbles on Google Docs, external IMDB rating embeds, opt-out autoplay on video sites What this broad compilation does not block: Newsletters, cookie banners, social media links to company pages

I know. We should give her a dick!". Well, not anymore, thanks to this list. Note 1: On some of these sites, such as Pixiv and Fur Affinity, quite a few futa images are uploaded without having "futa" in its title or in its search result metadata, making them practically unblockable through this method. Categories known to have significant slipthrough percentages are marked with a 🔴. Note 2: Because I know someone will ask me about it, if it's in 50min or 50 years: Sites like E621 should be very, very deeply ashamed of themselves, for treating "intersex" and "futanari" as the exact same thing. "Intersex" is an actual medical thing where someone have both male and female organs at the same time. "Futanari" is anti-woman, because its target audience is men who want to have sex with women but who are so frightened by vaginas that they cannot stand the sight of them, so they can only handle seeing male penises instead.

Also supports YouTube on mobile browsers (but sadly not the apps). Motivation: I do not think of this as protecting children. I see this as protecting all of mankind. No humans, old or young, should need to be subjected to Elsagate-style material. Note that in order to be really certain of avoiding Elsagate, especially in the case of children, this list also deactivates Autoplay and end-of-video links, but at the moment only on desktop browsers.

It denies the freedom to make transformative fan art, does not check if the seller has the skills to make art based on the purchase (s)he bought, and implies litigation threats that'd make Disney want the sellers' autographs. Here's how to avoid that shameful hateful culture.

If you are not interested in catgirls in bikinis looking at you meekly, but want to focus more on videogames, then this list is for you.

Important note: The list serves a very specific purpose, which is to show a higher percentage of original art when scrolling through sites for art to repost on e.g. Discord servers. In that specific context, official vectors copypasted on or next to simple backgrounds with text along the lines of "Your fav is demiromantic and sapphic", falls outside of that definition. I am generally speaking friendly to the LGBT community.

And for highly inexplicable reasons, a lot of online netizens seem to deeply crave to become the subjects of (or imposing) slavery, abuse, imprisonment, blatant rape, mauling, squishing, critical infections, death, and brutal death, among other things. If you are a sufficiently functional sentient being that you become physically sick from such notions (which you have all rights to get sick for), this list is how to lift yourself above such things.
